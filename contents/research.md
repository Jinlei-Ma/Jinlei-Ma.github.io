# Research Statement

My research lies at the intersection of urban carbon emissions, machine learning, and sustainable development. I am interested in:

- Modeling peak carbon emissions using data-driven approaches
- Understanding policy and technology interaction in emission pathways
- Building equitable, efficient carbon reduction mechanisms
