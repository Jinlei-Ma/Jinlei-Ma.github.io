Hi, Iâ€™m Jinlei Ma, an undergraduate student working exploring  the intersection of Earth System Science and AI for Social Science. My work focuses on leveraging machine learning to analyze coupled human-environment systems, climate-economic feedbacks, and AI-driven forecasting of societal transitions under planetary boundaries. I believe the first step to understanding complexity is to find structure in the chaos.
