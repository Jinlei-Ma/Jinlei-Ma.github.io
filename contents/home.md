#### ✨ About Me
Hi, I’m Jinlei Ma, an undergraduate student working exploring  the intersection of Earth System Science and AI for Social Science. My work focuses on leveraging machine learning to analyze coupled human-environment systems, climate-economic feedbacks, and AI-driven forecasting of societal transitions under planetary boundaries. I believe the first step to understanding complexity is to find structure in the chaos.
